### ADVERSARIAL PATCH ATTACK ON FACE RECOGNITION MODEL

- Phase - 1 consists of building the face recognition model 
- Phase - 2 trains an adversarial patch to attack the face recognition model
- Note that the dataset is private and hence cannot be shared
- Pytorch framework was used in both the phases
